# Python allows the else keyword to be used with the for loops and while loop as well.

for i in range (5):
# for i in []:
    print(i)

    # if i write here "if==4": "break" "Will the content of 'Else' be executed or not ?"
    # if (i==4):
    #     break

# The else block appears after the body of the loop.
# The statement in the else block will be executed after all iterations are completed.
else:
    print("Sorry no i")


# Same as while loop:
# i = 0
# while i < 7:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1
#     if i==4:
#         break

# else:
#     print("Sorry no i")
